# Market Impact of Renewables on Electricity Prices

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data analysis related to the paper **"Do we actually understand the impact of renewables on electricity prices? A causal inference approach"**. The study investigates the causal effect of wind and solar penetration on electricity market prices using **Double Machine Learning (DML)** techniques.

## Key Findings
- Increased wind and solar penetration can significantly impact within-day and day-ahead electricity market prices.
- **Causal Inference with DML** helps isolate the true effect of renewables while controlling for confounders.
- A **sliding window analysis** is employed to study how the effect varies across different penetration levels.
