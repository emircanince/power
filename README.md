### 1. Merit-order (LWPR) surfaces

| Solar penetration surface | Wind penetration surface |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| <img src="png/solar_2.png" alt="LWPR surface showing how the electricity price varies with solar-generation penetration and hour of day" width="95%"/> | <img src="png/wind_2.png" alt="LWPR surface showing how the electricity price varies with wind-generation penetration and hour of day" width="95%"/> |

**How to read the plots**

* **Axes** â€“ *Forecasted penetration [%]* on the x-axis, *Hour of the day* on the y-axis, and price in â‚¬/MWh on the z-axis.  
* **Colour bar** â€“ warmer colours signal higher prices; cooler colours indicate lower prices.  
* **Take-aways**  
  * **Solar (left):** Prices dip sharply during midday as solar share rises, but recover in the evening when solar output fades.  
  * **Wind (right):** Wind exerts a steadier, almost linear downward pressure across all hours; the slope flattens at very high penetrations (> 60 %).

### 2. Dose-response (CATE vs. observational mean)

| Solar: CATE vs mean | Wind: CATE vs mean |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| <img src="png/mean_vs_cate_solar.png" alt="Solar CATE (orange) compared to observational mean (grey) with 95 % confidence ribbons" width="95%"/> | <img src="png/mean_vs_cate_wind.png" alt="Wind CATE (blue) compared to observational mean (grey) with 95 % confidence ribbons" width="95%"/> |

**How to read the plots**

* **X-axis** â€“ Causal estimate (CATE) in â‚¬/MWh; negative values imply cheaper electricity.  
* **Y-axis** â€“ Forecasted penetration share in %.  
* **Lines & ribbons** â€“ Solid line = causal estimate with its 95 % bootstrap band; dashed line = raw observational mean.

**Insights**

* **Solar:** The causal estimate (orange) is more negative than the observational mean up to ~15 % penetration, signalling a stronger price-depressing effect after adjusting for confounders; beyond that, the impact attenuates.  
* **Wind:** The causal estimate (blue) stays consistently below the meanâ€”an indication that failing to correct for simultaneity biases *understates* windâ€™s price-lowering power, particularly between 20â€“50 % penetration.

## Summary

This thesis quantifies how **solar and wind penetration affect German day-ahead electricity prices** and benchmarks state-of-the-art deep-learning forecasters.

* **Causal side.** A locally weighted polynomial regression (LWPR) visualises the merit-order surface. A *locally-partial* double-machine-learning (DML) estimator then delivers **conditional average treatment effects (CATE)** that remain negative up to â‰ˆ 60 % wind share, with marginal price cuts of about **â‚¬ 0.8 per MWh** for the first 10 % of penetration.

* **Predictive side.** The custom **TimeXer** Transformer integrates endogenous price patches with variate-wise renewable and load tokens, achieving the lowest one-day MAE of **0.208 â‚¬/MWh**. For week-ahead horizons the parsimonious **DLinear** baseline prevails, underscoring the value of seasonal structure.

Overall, the work shows that *identification* (via DML) and *prediction* (via Transformers) complement each other when analysing power markets under high renewable penetration.

## Working with the repo

### Dependencies
Developed with **Python 3.9**, **PyTorch 2.2**, **LightGBM 4.3**, and HuggingFace **transformers**.  
All packages are pinned in `requirements.txt`.

### Setup
~~~bash
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/emircanince/power.git
cd power

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # on Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

---

## Reproducing results

### Causal analysis
Compute LWPR, the overall DML estimate, and the CATE-vs-mean plot:
~~~bash
python models/nonlinear_regression_models/LWPR_mean_wind.py
python models/double_machine_learning/DML_overall_wind.py
python models/double_machine_learning/dml_vs_mean_plot_wind.py
~~~
Each script writes a CSV of estimates and exports figures to `png/`.

### Forecasting experiments
Train and evaluate **TimeXer** (plus five baselines):
~~~bash
chmod +x scripts/TimeXer.sh      # run once if needed
bash ./scripts/TimeXer.sh --pred_len 24    # options: 24 / 48 / 96 / 168
~~~
The script handles data splits, checkpoints, and TensorBoard logging automatically.

### Visualization code
Open `Visualization.ipynb` to  
1. load bootstrapped CATE estimates and create dose-response plots,  
2. overlay LWPR mean surfaces with DML-based marginal effects, and  
3. animate TimeXerâ€™s forecast trajectory over training iterations.

### Pre-trained models
Download and unpack checkpoints:
~~~bash
unzip ckpt.zip -d ckpt
~~~
Copy the extracted folders into `./checkpoints/` to skip training.

## Results

* **Causal:** Wind penetration consistently lowers prices; solar effects taper beyond â‰ˆ 30 % noon share.  
* **Forecasting:** TimeXer leads for short horizons; DLinear excels week-ahead; Transformer variants show clear horizon-wise trade-offs.  
* **Robustness:** Bootstrap confidence intervals, residual diagnostics, and cross-validation confirm estimator stability.
